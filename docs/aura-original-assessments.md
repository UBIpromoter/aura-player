## Autism Traits (Aura Original)

**Measures:** Cognitive and social processing patterns associated with autism spectrum traits

**Structure:** 10 items

**Response Scale:** 4-point (Strongly Agree / Agree / Disagree / Strongly Disagree)

### Questions

**Detail Processing**
1. I notice things others seem to miss—small changes, background sounds, subtle patterns
2. When looking at something, I'm drawn to specific details before seeing the overall picture

**Cognitive Flexibility**
3. Switching between tasks quickly feels uncomfortable or draining
4. When interrupted, getting back into what I was doing takes significant effort

**Social Processing**
5. I often take what people say literally, then realize later they meant something else
6. Figuring out if someone wants to end a conversation doesn't come naturally to me

**Reading Others**
7. I rely on what people explicitly say rather than their tone or facial expressions
8. Understanding why characters in movies make certain decisions often puzzles me

**Systematizing**
9. I enjoy organizing information into categories, lists, or systems
10. Learning the rules or patterns behind how something works is deeply satisfying

### Scoring
- Items 1, 2, 9, 10: Score 1 for Agree/Strongly Agree
- Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8: Score 1 for Agree/Strongly Agree
- Total: 0-10
- Higher scores = more autism-associated traits

### Output
**Not a diagnosis.** Frame as cognitive style:

- 0-2: "Your processing style is predominantly neurotypical"
- 3-5: "You show some neurodivergent thinking patterns"
- 6-8: "You have several traits common in neurodivergent thinkers"
- 9-10: "Your cognitive style strongly aligns with neurodivergent patterns"

**Strength framing examples:**
- "Detail-oriented processing often correlates with catching errors others miss"
- "Systematic thinking is an asset in fields requiring precision and logic"
- "Taking things literally can mean you're refreshingly direct and honest"

## Attachment Style (Aura Original)

**Measures:** Two dimensions of relationship attachment
- **Anxiety:** Fear of rejection/abandonment, need for reassurance
- **Avoidance:** Discomfort with emotional closeness, preference for independence

**Structure:** 12 items (6 per dimension)

**Response Scale:** 7-point (1 = Strongly Disagree → 7 = Strongly Agree)

### Questions

**Anxiety Dimension**
1. When I don't hear from someone I care about, I tend to assume something is wrong
2. I find myself looking for signs that a partner might be losing interest
3. Feeling truly secure in a relationship is rare for me
4. I need more reassurance than most people that I'm valued
5. The possibility of being left weighs on me more than it probably should
6. I sometimes push for closeness in ways that feel desperate afterward

**Avoidance Dimension**
7. I feel most comfortable when I don't have to depend on anyone
8. Opening up emotionally makes me feel exposed in a bad way
9. When relationships get too close, I start wanting more space
10. I'd rather solve my problems alone than ask a partner for help
11. Keeping some emotional distance feels safer than full vulnerability
12. I've been told I'm hard to read or emotionally unavailable

### Scoring
- Average items 1-6 → Anxiety score (1-7)
- Average items 7-12 → Avoidance score (1-7)
- Median split (4) determines High/Low

### Attachment Styles

| Style | Anxiety | Avoidance | Description |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Secure** | Low (≤4) | Low (≤4) | Comfortable with intimacy and independence |
| **Anxious** | High (>4) | Low (≤4) | Craves closeness, fears abandonment |
| **Avoidant** | Low (≤4) | High (>4) | Values independence, uncomfortable with closeness |
| **Fearful** | High (>4) | High (>4) | Wants closeness but fears it |

### Output

**Secure:**
"You're comfortable with emotional intimacy and don't worry excessively about relationships. You can depend on others and let others depend on you."

**Anxious:**
"You value deep connection and are attuned to relationship dynamics—sometimes hyperattuned. You may seek reassurance more than others. Knowing this can help you communicate needs without spiraling."

**Avoidant:**
"You prize independence and self-reliance. Emotional vulnerability doesn't come naturally. This protects you but can limit intimacy. Recognizing the pattern is the first step."

**Fearful:**
"You want close relationships but find them anxiety-provoking. You may pull people close then push them away. This often stems from past experiences. Understanding the pattern helps break it."
