# Aura Player - Basic Structure
*Updated January 30, 2026 (vP)*

**One role: Player. One action: Answer.**

## Core Loop
See question → Tap answer → See community → Next

## Fixed Zones
1. **Nav** - progress, navigation
2. **Question** - the hero
3. **Response** - predictable button positions
4. **Community** - reward for answering

## Confidence (1-4)
- Single tap works (confidence 1)
- Multi-tap for power users
- Never required, always available

## Question Types
| Type | Resolves | Tracks Accuracy |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Opinion | Never | No |
| Factual | Immediate | Yes |
| Predictive | Future | Yes |
| Panel | Trusted consensus | Yes |
| Perpetual | Ongoing | Yes |

## Progression (invisible to user)
Play → Build track record → Unlock opportunities

## Screen Priority (when space is tight)
1. Response buttons (must be tappable)
2. Question text (must be readable)
3. Community (can shrink/collapse)

## Community Data (vP)
- 440 questions with realistic distribution estimates
- Based on AI analysis of how 1,000 diverse humans would respond
- Factual → high confidence consensus
- Controversial → split with moderate confidence
- Predictions → uncertainty spread
